# Hello, Life Skills

## What is Hello Life Skills?

HLS is a group project I am leading. It's a website for writing articles related to things young adults need to know about. The categories for articles are college, finance, health, tech, travel, and work. The idea was proposed by one of my former professors who mentioned wanting a site where young generations can learn about entering adulthood and all the things adults need to know about.

It started as a web development project from scratch, but that went pretty much nowhere, so I decided to simplify things and paid for shared hosting and installed Wordpress (on a CloudLinux LAMP stack). 

I paid for someone on Fiverr to make a logo for it. In addition to the website, I also maintain social media accounts for it (because that's how you drive traffic to sites nowadays).

Aside from the articles and technical stuff, this project demonstrates leadership skills and the ability to work in a group. It also requires scheduling and deadlines. Additionally, it's also just an excuse to meet up and hang out with people, socializing while also getting some work done on a side project. 

## Who is involved?

There are multiple contributor accounts, but at this point, Alan and John Y and Stephen are the only active contributors left. However, anyone is allowed to join. Other people have accounts, but they don't use them. I set contributors up with Wordpress accounts and @hellolifeskills.com email addresses with a Horde webmail login which I manage through cPanel.

## What are some of the articles so far?

Some of the articles on the site right now are about the SIUE career fair, studying abroad, basic information security tips, health, and credit scores.

## What tech has gone into the website?

Because it's on managed hosting and it's run in a CMS, I will just detail the things I have changed in this markdown file instead of putting the entire code on GitHub, which would be a pain, and it'd be unnecessary considering I didn't write the CMS.

The domain registrar is Namecheap. I get shared hosting from Namecheap. The SSL certificate is from COMODO. The main software used for the site is Wordpress.

### Wordpress customizations

The Wordpress installation is as follows:
